- 2-way classification problem : -ve and +ve classes

- Representation :
	Lines (Ax + By = C)
    - Specifically 
	- if Ax + By + C > 0 then classify "+ve"
	- Else classify "-ve"

- Evaluation : Number of misclassified examples.
- Optimization : An algorithm that searches for the three parameters : 
	A, B and C.


# How does machine learners solve this problem ?                                                                                                                                         
- Try different lines until you find that separates the data into two.                                                                                                                   
- A more plausible alternative                                                                                                                                                           
        - Begin with a random line                                                                                                                                                       
        - Repeat until no errors                                                                                                                                                         
        - For each point :                                                                                                                                                               
                - If the current line says +ve and point is -ve then decrease A, B and C.                                                                                                
                - If the current line says -ve and point is +ve then increase A, B and C.
