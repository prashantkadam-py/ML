# Occam's Razor :
	- All other things being equal, the simplest solution is the best.

	- __Rule of thumb__ :
		Prefer the simplest hypothesis that fits the data.

	- A simpler hypothesis is less likely to be correct "by chance" and is therefor more likely to generalize well.

	- If we have 2 hypothesis with equally small training error, how can we pick the right one?
		- If we pick the wrong one, with enough data, we will eventually find out.
	
	- The amount of data we need (to be sure we pick the right hypothesis) depends on the complexity of the hypothesis class.
	- If we want to avoid the possibility of overfitting, we should restrict the complexity of the hypothesis class, or use a larger training set.
	- An overly simple hypothesis class may underfit.
