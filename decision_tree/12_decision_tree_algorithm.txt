# Decision Tree Learning Algorithm

GROWTREE(S)

if (y = 0 for all <x, y> C- S) return new leaf(0)

else if (y = 1 for all <x, y> C- S) return new leaf(1)

else
	choose best attribute xj
	S0 = all <x, y> C- S with xj = 0;
	S1 = all <x, y> C- S with xj = 1;
	return new node(xj, GROWTREE(S0), GROWTREE(S1))
