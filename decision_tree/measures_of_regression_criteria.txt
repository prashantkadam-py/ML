1. Mean Squared Error : 
	
	ym = 1/Nm E y
		 yC-Qm

	H(Qm) = 1/Nm  E   (y - ym) ** 2
		     yC-Qm		

2. Half Poisson deviance :

	H(Qm) = 1/Nm   E     (ylog y/ym -y + ym)
		      yC-Qm 			

Setting criterion="poisson" might be a good choice if your target is a count or a frequency (count per some unit). In any case,  is a necessary condition to use this criterion. Note that it fits much slower than the MSE criterion.

3. Mean Absolute Error:
	
	meadian(y)m = median(y)
			yC-Qm


	H(Qm) = 1/Nm E | y - median(y)m|
		    yC-Qm
	
Note that it fits much slower than the MSE criterion.
