# Overfitting 

- In logistic regression we use MCLE (Maximum Conditional Log-likelihood Estimation). It prefers higher weights.
- Higher likelihood of (properly classified) examples are close to decision boundary.
- larger influence of corresponding features on decision. 
- can cause overfitting! (Higher weights can cause overfitting)

- Regularization : penalize high weights to avoid overfitting.
