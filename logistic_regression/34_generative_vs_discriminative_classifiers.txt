# Generative vs Discriminative Classifiers

## Generative Classifiers 

	- eg. Naive Bayes
	- Assume some functional form for P(X|Y) likelihood, P(Y) prior
	- Estimate parameters of P(X|Y) , P(Y) directly from training data.
	- Use Bayes rule to calculate P(Y|X=x)
	- This is a generative model because :
		- Indirect computation of P(Y|X) through Bayes rule.
		- As a result, can also generate sample of the data,  
			P(X) = E  P(y) P(X|Y)
			       y


## Discriminative Classifiers
	- eg. Logistic Regression.
	- Assume functional form for P(Y|X)
	- Estimate parameters of P(Y|X) directly from training data.
	- This is a discriminative model because : 
		- Directly learn P(Y|X)
		- But cannot obtain sample of data, because P(X) is not available.
