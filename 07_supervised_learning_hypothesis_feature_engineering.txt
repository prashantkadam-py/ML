# Steps in Supervised Learning                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                         
1. Determine the representation (Alorithm) for "x, f(x)" and determine what "x" to use __(Feature Engineering)__.                                                                        
2. Gather a training set (not all data is kosher) (Data Cleaning).                                                                                                                       
3. Select a suitable evaluation method.                                                                                                                                                  
4. Find a suitable learning algorithm among a plethora of available choices. 

# Hypothesis Space: (Video - 07)                                                                                                                                                         
- Learning is the removal of uncertainity.                                                                                                                                               
- Learning requires guessing good, small hypothesis case.                                                                                                                                
- We could be wrong!                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                         
    - Our prior knowledge might be wrong!                                                                                                                                                
    - Our guess for hypothesis class could be wrong!                                                                                                                                     
        - The smaller the hypothesis class, more likely we are wrong!                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                         
- Example 1: {x1, x3, x4} if two of them is true => y is also consistent with the training data.                                                                                         
- Example 2: x4 ^ Oneof{x1, x3} => y is also consistent with the training data.                                                                                                          
- Example 3: x4 ^ ~x2 => y is also consistent with the training data.                                                                                                                    
- If either of these is the unknown function, then we will make errors when we are given new x.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                         
- For Less data Example 1, 2 and 3 all are valid hypothesis.                                                                                                                             
- For more data these above valid hypothesis can be checked against counter examples to get more appropriate valid hypothesis. 


# Feature Engineering is the Key:
- Most effort in ML projects is constructing features.
- Black art : Intuition, creativity required 
	- Understand properties of the task at hand
	- How the features interact with or limit the algorithm you are using.

- ML is an iterative process.
	- Try different types of features, experiment with each and then decide which feature set / algorithm combination to use.

- If two features correlate each other then discard one.
- If features are not correlated with output then discard them.
