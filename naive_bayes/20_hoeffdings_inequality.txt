# Hoeffding's Inequality use : 
Hoeffding's Inequality gives us the number of data points need to collect to reliably estimate the parameter value.


# A bound (from Hoeffding's inequality)

For N = aH + aT, 
and
	Q^MLE = aH/(aH + aT)


Let Q* be the true parameter, for any epsilon > 0:

	P(|Q^ - Q*| >= epsilon) (probablity of making mistake) <= 2e**[-2N * (epsilon**2)]

	Q^ - point of estimation MLE 
	Q* - true parameter
	epsilon - amount of error willing to allow in MLE calculation
	

Example : 
	I want to know the coin flip Q within epsilon = 0.1, with the probability of mistake delta <= 0.05

        How many flips ? Or how big do i set N ? 
		
		P(mistake) is less than or equal to 2e**[-2N * (epsilon**2)] <= delta


		substituting values,
			ln delta >= ln 2 - 2N(epsilon)**2  (epsilon = 0.1 and delta <= 0.05) = 190


	We can reliably estimate Q parameter MLE by tossing coin 190 times bounded to delta <= 0.05 and epsilon = 0.1.
