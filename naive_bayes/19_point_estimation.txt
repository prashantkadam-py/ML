- Flipped a coin 5 times and we got 3 heads, 2 tails. What's the probability of getting heads. 
	
	The probability of getting heads is P(H) = 3/5

- These flips are i.i.d (Independent identical distribution) 
	- independent events.
	- identically distributed according to Binomial distribution.


- Sequence D of aH Heads and aT Tails

	P(D|Q) = Q**aH (1-Q)**aT  ----> Binomial Distribution	

	D : Data
	Q : Parameter
	aH : Number of heads
	aT : Number of tails


- Data : Observed set D of aH heads and aT tails 
- Hypothesis : Binomial Distribution
- Learning : finding Q is an optimization problem.
	- What's the objective function ?
		P(D|Q) = Q**aH (1-Q)**aT 

- MLE : Choose Q to maximize probability of D.

	Q^ = argmax    P(D|Q) 
		Q

	   = argmax   ln P(D|Q)


- First parameter learning algorithm :
	
	Q^ = argmax ln P(D|Q) 
		Q   
		
	   = argmax ln (Q**aH (1-Q)**aT)
		Q

   argmax = d/dQ
		
   d/dQ ln P(D|Q) = d/dQ [ln Q**aH (1-Q)**aT]
		  = d/dQ [aH ln(Q) + aT ln(1-Q)]
			
                  = aH d/dQ ln(Q) + aT d/dQ ln(1-Q)
		  = (aH/Q) - (aT/1-Q) = 0 (set to 0 maximize)

   Q^MLE = aH/(aH + aT) = 3/5 = P(H)
