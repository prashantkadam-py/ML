# Bias Variance Tradeoff

## Error due to Bias
- Difference betweem expected prediction of our model and correct value
- Repeat for different data sets, measure how far off predictions from correct value

## Error due to Variance
- Variability of model predictions for a given datapoint
- Measure how much predictions for a given data point varies across the models.

- There is usually bias-variance tradeoff caused by model complexity.

- Complex models (many parameters) usually have low bias, but high variance.

- Simple models (few parameters) usually have high bias, but low variance.
