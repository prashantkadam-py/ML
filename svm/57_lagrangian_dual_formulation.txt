# LAGRANGE DUALITY

## Consider a problem of form :

1. min f(w)
   w

2. subject to 

	hi(w) = 0     i=0,1,2,.....l

## LAGRANGIAN : 
                    l
L(w, beta) = f(w) + E   beta * hi(w)
                    i=1


	beta - Lagrange multipliers
	0 to l - data instances
	
set L's partial derivative to 0.

dL/dwi = 0       dL/dbetai = 0

solve for w and beta.

- Generalize to constrained optimization problem which may have equality as well as inequality constraints.

## PRIMAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM : 

min f(w)
 w 

subject to gi(w) <= 0  i = 1, ......... k  -- inequality constraint
	   hi(w) = 0   i = 1, ......... l  -- equality constraint





## GENERALIZED LAGRANGIAN : 
                           k                    l
L(w, alpha, beta) = f(w) + E   alphai * gi(w) + E betai * hi(w)
			   i=1                  i=1

alpha's and beta's are Lagranges Multipliers.

Qp(w) =       max                         L(w, alpha, beta)
	alpha, beta : alphai >= 0      


                                                 k                l
Qp(w) =       max                         f(w) + E alphai gi(w) + E  betai hi(w)
          alpha, beta : alphai >= 0              i=1              i=1


If w violates constraints then Qp(w) = infinity

Qp(w)   = f(w)         if w satisfies the primal constraints

	= infinity     if w violates the primal constraints


Consider, 

min Qp(w) =  min          max                 L(w, alpha, beta)
 w	      w   alpha,beta:alphai >=0  

- primal optimization --> p* = Qp(w) --> maximize w.r.to alpha and beta  
- dual optimization --> d* = Qd(w) --> maximize w.r.to  w


        max             Qd(alpha, beta) =           max               min   L(w, alpha, beta)
alpha,beta:alphai >=0                        alpha,beta:alphai >=0     w
 
                           
- same as primal problem, order of max and min are exchanged.

## RELATION BETWEEN PRIMAL and DUAL :

 d* <= p*

- max and min of fn always <= min max of fn

- under certain conditions d* = p*
- so that we can solve dual problem instead of primal problem.
- suppose f and gi's are convex, and hi's are affine (linear + intercept) and constraints gi are strictly feasible and there is w such that,
  under above assumptions, there exists w*, alpha*, beta* so that w* is the solution to the primal problem and alpha*, beta* are solutions to the dual problem.
- Moreover, w*, alpha* and beta* satisfy KARUSH-KUHN-TUCKER (KKT) conditions.
    d/dwi         L(w*, alpha*, beta*)  = 0  i = 1, ........, m ------- 1
    d/dbetai      L(w*, alpha*, beta*) = 0   i=1, ........., l -------- 2

		alpha*gi(w*) = 0,   i=1,......,k ------- 3
		gi(w*) <= 0,        i=1, ......,k ------ 4
		alpha* >= 0         i=1, ......, k -----5 

	If some w*, alpha*, beta* satisfies the kkt conditions, then it is a solution to primal and dual problems.


	gi(w) = 0  --- points are on margin then alpha has to be non zero value to satisfy condition 3
	gi(w) non zero means alpha has to be zero to satisfy condition 3
