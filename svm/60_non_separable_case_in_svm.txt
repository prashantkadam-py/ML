# SVM REGULARIZATION

## GOAL : 
1. avoid overfitting.
2. make algorithm less sensitive to outliers.
3. extend algorithm to work for non-linearly separable datasets.

## OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM WITH L1 REGULARIZATION
                               m
  min        1/2 ||w||**2 + C  E psi       i=1,2,....,m  
r, w, b                       i=1


   psi >= 0 for i=1,....,m

   C - coefficient of total slack / amount of weight given to total slack

- higher value of C means we allow less slack
- low value of C means more slack
- Permit training examples to have functional margin less than 1. Functional margin 1-psi. (with psi > 0) 

## NEW LAGRANGIAN SVM equation
                                            m         m                                        m 
L (w, b, psi, alpha, r) = 1/2 w * w**T + C  E  psi -  E  alphai[yi (w**T Xi + b) - (1+psi)] -  E  ri psii     --- A
                                           i=1       i=1                                      i=1         

			   original      total             inequality               new                inequality 
                           distance      slack             constraint              margin         constraint for slack 


- alphai and ri are lagrange multipliers.
- psi = 0 - no slack
- psi > 0  - some slack

- set derivative w.r.to w, b and psi to zero.

dL/dw = w - E alphai * yi * xi

w = E alphai * yi * xi  -----------1

         m  
dL/db =  E  alphai * yi  = 0 ------- 2
        i=1

dL/dpsi = C - alphak - rk = 0 --------- 3

	rk = C - alphak and rk >= 0
	alphai >= 0
 
substitute 1, 2, 3 in eqn A, we get the dual,

                       m                     m 
  max      W(alpha) =  E       alphai - 1/2  E  yi * yj * alphai * alphaj {xi, xj}
 alpha                i,j=1                 i,j


	subject to, 0 <= alphai <= C    i = 1,2,....,m
        m 
	E    alphai * yi = 0
       i=1

- After regularization, equation remains same the only difference is alphai is bound to,
	 0 <= alphai <= C
