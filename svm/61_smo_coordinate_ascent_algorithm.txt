# SOLVING THE DUAL PROBLEM 

## COORDINATE ASCENT

consider unconstrained optimization problem

   max      W(alpha1, alpha2, ....., alpham)
  alpha

  W is a function of parameters alphai's.

## ALGORITHM FOR COORDINATE ASCENT : 	
Loop until convergence : {
for i = 1, ...., m {
   alphai  :=   argmax   W(alphai, alphai-1, .....alpham)
                alphai
}               
}

- HOLD ALL VARIABLES EXCEPT alphai fixed and reoptimize W w.r.to alphai

- can we hold alpah2 to alpham fixed and take a coordinate ascent step and reoptimize the objective w.r.to alpha1 ? 
	NO , Because, 
		                        m 
			alpha1 y(1) = - E    alphai y(i)
					i=2
                                       m
			alpha1 = -y(1) E   alphai y(i)
				       i=2	

			[since  y(1) c- {-1, 1}, (y(1))**2 = 1]	 

- since alpha1 is exactly determined by the other alphai's, if we hold alpha2 to alpham fixed, we can't change alphai.

## SMO coordinate ascent algorithm 

REPEAT UNTIL CONVERGENCE {
1. select some pair alphai and alphaj to update next 
[use hueristic that picks two alpha's that will allow us to make the biggest progress towards gloabal maximum]
2. Reoptimize W(alpha) w.r.to alphai and alphaj, while holding all the other alphak's (k != i, j) fixed
}

- update to alphai and alphaj can be computed efficiently.
	                      m
alpha1 y(1) + alpha2 y(2) = - E   alphai y(i)     -- fixed can be replaced by some constant
                              i=3
